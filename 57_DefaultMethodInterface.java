In Java, a default method in an interface is like a special method that provides a default (predefined) implementation. It allows you to add new methods to an existing interface without breaking the classes that already implement it. Let's understand this concept in an easy and understandable way:

Imagine you have an interface called "Animal" that represents common behavior for all animals:

java
Copy code
interface Animal {
    void eat();
    void sleep();
}
Now, you want to add a new method called "makeSound()" to the "Animal" interface. However, if you simply add this new method to the interface, all the classes that implement the "Animal" interface will have a compilation error because they need to provide an implementation for the new method. This could be problematic, especially if you don't want to modify existing code.

This is where the default method comes in:

java
Copy code
interface Animal {
    void eat();
    void sleep();

    default void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a generic sound.");
    }
}
With the addition of the "default" keyword before the method, "makeSound()" now has a default implementation. This means any existing classes that implement the "Animal" interface will automatically inherit this default implementation of "makeSound()" without needing to modify their code.

For example, let's say we have a class called "Cat" that implements the "Animal" interface:

java
Copy code
class Cat implements Animal {
    @Override
    public void eat() {
        System.out.println("Cat eats.");
    }

    @Override
    public void sleep() {
        System.out.println("Cat sleeps.");
    }
}
Since the "Cat" class implements the "Animal" interface, it automatically inherits the default implementation of "makeSound()" without having to provide its own implementation.

Now, if we create an instance of the "Cat" class and call the "makeSound()" method:

java
Copy code
public static void main(String[] args) {
    Cat cat = new Cat();
    cat.makeSound(); // Output: "Animal makes a generic sound."
}
The "makeSound()" method from the "Animal" interface gets executed, printing "Animal makes a generic sound."

Default methods are a useful feature in Java, especially when you want to add new functionality to existing interfaces without breaking the classes that already implement them. It provides a backward-compatible way to evolve interfaces over time.
