// start(): Imagine you're launching a rocket. The start() method ignites the thread and begins its execution. It's like pressing the "launch" button for a thread.

// run(): This method contains the actual task the thread will perform. It's like the instructions for the rocket's flight. When you call start(), it's as if you've given the rocket the green light to follow those instructions.

// sleep(): Think of this as a pause button. The sleep() method lets the thread pause for a specified amount of time before continuing. It's like having the rocket pause for a moment before resuming its flight.

// join(): Imagine you're in a car rally and want to wait for your friend's car to catch up. The join() method makes the current thread wait for another thread to finish before it continues. It's like waiting for your friend's car to catch up before you proceed.

// yield(): This method is like saying, "I'm giving other threads a chance to work." It's a hint to the system that the thread is willing to yield its turn to other threads. It's like letting other cars take a turn on the road.

// isAlive(): This method checks whether a thread is still active. It's like asking if the rocket is still in the air or has landed.

// getName(): Just as you have a name, a thread has a name too. This method gets the name of the thread. It's like finding out the name of a car in the rally.

// setPriority(): This method sets the priority of the thread, indicating how important it is. It's like giving a car a priority level in the rally, determining how much attention it gets.

// getId(): Every thread has a unique identifier. This method gets the ID of the thread. It's like having a special number for each car in the rally.

// interrupt(): Think of this as sending a signal to stop a thread's current operation. It's like using a signal to stop a car on the road.

// Remember, these methods are tools you can use to control and manage threads, making your Java programs more efficient and responsive. Just like using tools to navigate and manage different aspects of a race or journey, these thread methods help you guide your threads in the right direction.
