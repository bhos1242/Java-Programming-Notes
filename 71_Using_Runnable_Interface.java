Imagine you're hosting a dinner party,and you need help setting the table and cooking.You could hire two assistants who each have specific tasks.Similarly,the Runnable
interface in
Java lets
you define
tasks that
different threads
can perform concurrently.Here's
how it works:

Create a
Class Implementing Runnable:
Think of this
as hiring
an assistant.
You create a

class that implements the Runnable interface.This
class defines
the task
you want
the thread to do.

Override the

run() Method: Inside your assistant's job description, you specify what they should do. Similarly, in your class that implements Runnable, you override the run() method and put the code for the task you want the thread to perform.

Create a Thread and Pass the Runnable: Now, you need to hire a thread and assign the assistant's task to it. You create a Thread object, passing an instance of your Runnable class to it.

Start the Thread: This is like telling your assistant to start working. You call the start() method on the Thread object to begin the execution of the task defined in your run() method.

Here's a straightforward example to illustrate this process:

java
Copy code
// Step 1: Create a class implementing the Runnable interface
class TableSettingTask implements Runnable {
    // Step 2: Override the run() method with the task
    @Override
    public void run() {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
            System.out.println("Assistant " + Thread.currentThread().getId() + " is setting the table for guest " + i);
        }
    }
}

public class RunnableThreadExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Step 3: Create a Thread and pass the Runnable
        TableSettingTask tableAssistant = new TableSettingTask();
        Thread thread1 = new Thread(tableAssistant);  // Hiring the first assistant
        Thread thread2 = new Thread(tableAssistant);  // Hiring the second assistant

        // Step 4: Start the threads (assistants)
        thread1.start();
        thread2.start();
    }
}
In this analogy:

TableSettingTask is like the assistant's job description, implementing the Runnable interface and defining the task in the run() method.
In the main method, we create two instances of the Thread class (thread1 and thread2), and we pass the TableSettingTask instance to them.
When we call start() on each thread, it's like telling the assistants to start setting the table concurrently.
When you run this program, you'll see the assistants (threads) setting the table for each guest. The order in which they work might vary because they're doing their tasks concurrently.

That's how you create and start a thread in Java using the Runnable interface. It's a flexible way to achieve multithreading and perform tasks concurrently in your programs.
